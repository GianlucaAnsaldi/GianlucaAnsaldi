## Abut me

I am a Junior Full-Stack Developer, fresh out of Makers Academy bootcamp. Before that, an aspiring football player with a passion for data and finance. I moved to London in 2016 to pursue a career in this sector and I've worked as a Data Analyst for one of the most prestigious data providers in the financial industry. <br><br>
I’ve always been a hardworking and fast learner individual seeking to improve myself and develop day by day and that was something that helped me in my years as a Data Analyst. Responsible and reliable, I have a keen eye for detail and good communication skills. During my career, I have grown as a subject-matter expert for the financial products I was covering, sharing my knowledge with the team and supporting them in a variety of projects and initiatives across different areas including, but not limited to, assuring data quality, generating efficiencies and workflow optimisation. 

## Why coding?

I bumped into coding for the first time when I was 16 years old in high school, learning COBOL with a professor that wasn't really able get us passionate about it, so I took a different path at Uni and now here I am at it again, with a completely different perspective and a lot more experience as a person compared to that kid back in high school.

What brought me back to coding is the fact that having such a career is a journey where you constantly need to evolve and learn, not knowing something is the normality and there is no shame in admitting it.

## Soft Skills

**Fast learner and curious**<br>
At Makers I was comfortable moving from Ruby to Javascript and to even go as far as using Python for our last group project. In my previous role I joined the team without knowing a single thing about the product and after 6 months I was already doing quality control on the work of my peers and I was part of the standard committee responsible to set and review the practices for the teams across EMEA, US and APAC regions.

**Problem solver and logical thinker**<br>
I like to take on complex problems and find a solution to them. I like to understand why something is done the way it is and I’m not afraid to raise questions and have conversations with people to understand/explain how something works and how it could be improved. I approach every problem breaking it down into smaller challenges and trying to find different solutions to put the puzzle back together.

**Attention to detail**<br>
I am used to work with large amount of data and complicated tools, In my previous role I was the person designated to ensure the quality of our product in the EMEA region and I was reviewing thousands of data points each day. This is something that I found very useful in coding, especially when it comes to debugging and fixing logics.

**Reliable and responsible**<br>
That is something innate in me, once I take on some responsibilities you can be sure that I can be entrusted with those. I am more than happy to ask for help and delegate if needed, but I will always go the extra mile to deliver what I promised. In my previous role I have been working closely with our News department to produce Leveraged Finance reports for our clients every month. During all that time I’ve always managed to organise my work in such a way to be able to deliver the necessary data to them on the first business day of every month, organising my day-to-day work as well as my vacations accordingly.

**Stakeholder Management and good communication**<br>
I have experience in a global organisation with teams from all around the world, I know how to communicate effectively, and I’ve been part of many large projects where I always brought my contribution. In our group projects at Makers I was always involved in the decision making process as this is something that I’ve done several times in my previous role. There I also learned how to manage expectations and how to deal with clients and different stakeholders, both internal and external to the company.

**Team work and leadership**<br>
From my days as a football player, to my previous career, I know exactly what it means to be part of a team and get everyone to aim for the same goal. I've experienced many different situations in teams, from being the new joiner with no experience about the product to becoming the subject matter expert and being responsbile for the training of new hires and interns, but what never changed for me was my attitude towards getting every chance to learn from everyone and share my knowledge with others to help them and the whole team to achieve a greater goal.
